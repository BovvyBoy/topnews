NEWS Top 3

This is a news ap that scrapes 3 different News sources and puts out their top 5 stories.

I have hard coded the sources and they are:
AP -The Associated Press
BBC - Britist Broadcast Company
The Bureau of Investigative Journalism

The ap allows you to search news by individual channels - shows you the top 5 stories for that channel.
You can search via the topics which are hard coded but can be added - this will display the top stories for.
BBC and AP as The Bureau of Investigative Journalism sorts their storys in a different way.
Then you can just chose the option to display the top 5 stories for each channel.

## Installation

- 'cd' into project folder.
- Run 'Bundle install' - To make sure you have all the gems needed
- In terminal type 'ruby bin/run.rb'
- Follow instructions on ap
