## Raising an Issue to Encourage a Contribution

If you notice a problem with the app that you believe needs improvement
but you're unable to make the change yourself, you should raise a Github issue
containing a clear description of the problem. Include relevant snippets of
the content and/or screenshots if applicable. Curriculum owners regularly review
issue lists and your issue will be prioritized and addressed as appropriate.

## Submitting a Pull Request to Suggest an Improvement

If you see an opportunity for improvement and can make the change yourself go
ahead and use a typical git workflow to make it happen:

* Fork this curriculum repository
* Make the change on your fork, with descriptive commits in the standard format
* Open a Pull Request against this repo

A curriculum owner will review your change and approve or comment on it in due
course.
